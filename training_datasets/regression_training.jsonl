Also if the red wine contains more quantity of volatile acidity,  citric acid, chlorides, density or pH its quality goes down, especially with the chlorides. The good qualities in red wine are the abundance of sulfates and alcohol. The free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide and the residual sugar present in the red wine take no action in determining whether we are presenting a high-quality or low-quality red wine. High-quality red wines seem to have lower volatile acidity, higher alcohol, and medium-high sulfate values. Meanwhile, lower-quality red wines tend to have low values for citric acid.

The weekly hours you dedicate to studying and the participation you have in class (element that is calculated from 0 to 1) are linear variables that will increase linearly, among these the hours you dedicate stand out, since even if the participation is low, the element that makes the grade improve significantly is the one related to the study hours. In the case of the attendance variable, there is no linear relationship, on the contrary it is quadratic. In other words, the impact of this on the dependent variable does not increase or decrease constantly, but it can have an accelerated growth or decrease, in this case being positive, it maintains an accelerated growth. The conclusions that we can derive from this is that at first a change in the low range of the attendance percentage does not result in a great difference in the final grade, but in higher percentages this difference becomes very noticeable. Therefore, if you want to improve your final grade with low attendance, improving this characteristic may not have as many rewards as weekly hours dedicated, but if you already have a high attendance percentage, it would be advisable to continue showing up to class since the quadratic growth of the variable would help to significantly improve."}]}

[H+] denotes the molar hydrogen ion concentration. Notice that we are required to take the common (base 10) logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration in order to calculate PH. Because pH is a measure of hydrogen (its syllables are literally 'power of hydrogen',) ion concentration, it is used to quantitatively characterize solutions as acidic, neutral, or basic (alkaline). The typical PH scale runs from 0 - 14. A PH of 7 is neutral, a PH < 7 is called acidic while PH > 7 is called basic.By this, for every one decrease (due to the negative sign) in the pH, the acidity increases by a factor of ten (A pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a pH of 4, and is 100 times more acidic than a pH of 5).
