FIRST LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

    modelo -> quality = 8.38 + 0.01*fixed acidity -1.10*volatile acidity -0.15*citric acid -0.00*residual sugar -1.47*chlorides + 0.00*free sulfur dioxide -0.00*total sulfur dioxide -4.52*density -0.37*pH + 0.98*sulphates + 0.29*alcohol
    label -> quality
    feature -> fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, Alcohol
    tipo de modelo -> regression

    when we can do something about bias -> A majority of the quality values were “regular” (5 and 6), which made no significant contribution to finding an optimal model. These values made it harder to identify each factor’s different influence on a “high” or “low” quality of the wine, which was the main focus of this analysis. In order to improve our predictive model, we need more balanced data.
